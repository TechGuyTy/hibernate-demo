# Spring Labs
## Lab 1
- Use Spring MVC to create a page listing all Coffee Machines at Grand Circus. (/coffee-machines.html)
- Then Create a page that displays the details of a single coffee machine. The machine is selected by ID (/coffee-machine.html?id=1)
- Create links from the listing page to the individual details page for each machine in the list. The link will need to include the ID of the machine as a parameter.

## Lab 2
- Modify the coffee machine details page from lab 1 to be editable with a form to update the details of the coffee machine.
